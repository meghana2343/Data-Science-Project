Hello! this is my data science project where i would be uploading my progress of my project in here.

 Stock Price Prediction using Machine Learning & Deep Learning

This repository explores **Stock Price Prediction** using multiple **Machine Learning** and **Deep Learning** algorithms — including Linear Regression, Random Forest, LSTM.  

The project demonstrates how deep learning models, outperform traditional approaches in capturing sequential dependencies in time-series financial data.



 Project Overview

Predicting stock prices is a challenging task due to the **volatile and non-linear** nature of financial markets.  
This project aims to:

- Compare traditional ML models with deep learning architectures  
- Evaluate performance using MAE, RMSE, and R² metrics  
- Visualize predictions versus actual stock prices  




## 🧠 Models Implemented

| Category | Algorithms |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Traditional ML** | Linear Regression, Random Forest Regressor, Support Vector Regressor |
| **Deep Learning** | LSTM.


## 📊 Dataset

- **Source:** Nasdaq/ Kaggle  
- **Features Used:** Open, High, Low, Close, Volume  
- **Target:** Next day’s closing price  


⚙️ Workflow

1. **Data Collection:** Download stock data using `nasdaq`.  
2. **Preprocessing:** Handle missing values, normalize data, and create time windows.  
3. **Feature Engineering:** Add technical indicators and rolling statistics.  
4. **Model Training:** Train different ML and DL models.  
5. **Evaluation:** Compare models based on error metrics and visualizations.  
6. **Conclusion:**
